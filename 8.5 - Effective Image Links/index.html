            <p><strong>El Capitan</strong> is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical rock 
            formation in Yosemite National Park, located on the north side of 
            Yosemite Valley, near its western end.  The granite monolith is one 
            of the world's favorite challenges for rock climbers.  The formation 
            was named "El Capitan" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored 
            the valley in 1851.  </p>

            <p><strong>Tunnel View</strong> is a viewpoint on State Route 41 
            located directly east of the Wawona Tunnel as one enters Yosemite 
            Valley from the south.  The view looks east into Yosemite Valley 
            including the southwest face of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil 
            Falls.  This is, to many, the first views of the popular attractions 
            in Yosemite.  </p>
