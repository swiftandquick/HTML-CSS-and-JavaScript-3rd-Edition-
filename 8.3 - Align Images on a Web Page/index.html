            <strong>El Capitan</strong> is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical 
            rock formation in Yosemite National Park, located on the north 
            side of Yosemite Valley, near its western end.  The granite 
            monolith is one of the world's favorite challenges for rock 
            climbers.  The formation was named "El Capitan" by the Mariposa 
            Battalion when it explored the valley in 1851.  </p>

            <strong>Tunnel View</strong> is a viewpoint on State Route 41 located 
            directly east of the Wawona Tunnel as one enters Yosemite Valley 
            including the southwest face of the El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil 
            Falls.  That is, to many, the first views of the popular attractions 
            in Yosemite.</p>
