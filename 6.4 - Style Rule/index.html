                Authors and actors and artists are such<br>
                Never know nothing, and never know much.<br>
                Sculptors and singers and those of their kidney<br>
                Tell their affairs from Seattle to Sydney.

            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Playwrights and poets and such horses' necks<br>
                Start off from anywhere, and end up at sex.<br>
                Diarists, critics, and similar roe<br>
                Never say nothing, and never say no.
